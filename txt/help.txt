    Pasting sequences:
</b>
<p>
   Ensure that the pasted sequence only contains a string of single letter amino acid codes.
<br>
   Pasted sequences can only be uploaded one at a time. 
<br>
   Between successive uploads, the 'upload' button must be clicked to clear the field.
<br>
   A successful upload of a pasted sequence is reflected in the counter below the field.

<b id="file_upload">
    File upload:
</b>
<p>
    The server can recognize the contents of the following file formats:
<br>
    Alignment files: <a href="/salign/formats.html#pir">PIR</a> or <a href="/salign/formats.html#fasta">FASTA</a>
<br>    
    Structure files: <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">PDB</a> format (atomic coordinate files can have '.ent', '.pdb' or no extension at all)
<br>    
    Compressed files (.zip or .tar.gzip) consisting of files of one or more of the above formats are also allowed.
<br><br>
    Multiple files can be uploaded by iteratively clicking 'upload' after every upload.
<br><br>
    PIR structure entries are considered structures if the corresponding PDB file can be found among the uploaded files or in the Sali Lab PDB library.
<br>
    If not found it is simply considered a sequence.
<br><br>
    The web page displays all files that have been uploaded, their sizes and when they were uploaded (when they were compressed for compressed files).

<b id="lib_PDBs">
    Choosing PDB structures:
</b>
<p>
    The user can choose structures to align from the PDB without having to upload his/her own structure files.
<br><br>
    Structures are chosen by entering their 4 letter PDB codes.
<br>
    Multiple structures are entered on separate lines.
<br>
    Each PDB should be entered only once, even if several segments of the same PDB are to be aligned.
<br>
    Residue ranges are chosen in the next step.

<b id="ali_cat_choice">
    Choice of alignment category:
</b> 
<p>
    Upon submission of the start page inputs the SALIGN server determines the alignment category which is likely to produce the most accurate alignment.
<br>
    Click <a href="/salign/app_note.html">here</a> for more information about the decision process
<br>
    The proposed alignment category can be changed by pressing 'Advanced' if other options exist.
<br>

<br>
    
<b id="segments">
    PDB segments:
</b>
<p>
    Segments of the structure files can be chosen by specifying the capping residues and chain identifiers
<br>    
    eg. 1a0l  20:A:40:A   will choose residues 20 though 40 from chain A of the PDB file identified as 1a0l
<br><br>
     Default values of the structure segment always span all residues of the first chain of the given structure file.
<br>
     If residue ranges are specified in the input PIR files, these are taken instead of the default. 
<br>
    Multiple segments from the same PDB should be entered on separate lines.
<br>
    If the user chooses to only align the sequences of structures (advanced), the segments to align are still to be set here.
</p>
<br>


<b id="ali_cat">
    Alignment category:
</b>
<p>
    The user can override the default alignment category choice. 
<br><br><i>
    Examples:
<br><br>
    If only structures have been uploaded, SALIGN will by default do a multiple structure alignment. This can be overridden to perform a multiple sequence alignment instead. Structure-sequence alignment is not an option when only structures have been uploaded. See third example below for structure-sequence.
<br><br>
    If two sets of sequences have been uploaded, SALIGN will by default align each set separately, then align the resulting profiles to each other. This can be overriden to perform a multiple sequence alignment of all uploaded sequences instead.
<br><br>
    If structures and sequences have been uploaded, SALIGN will by default do a structure-sequence alignment. This can be overriden to perform a multiple sequence alignment instead.
</i><br><br>
    Only viable alternatives to the alignment category are displayed.

<b id="ali_type">
    Optimal alignment type:
</b>
<p>
    To optimize alignment time and quality the following scheme has been chosen as default:
<br>    
    30 structures/sequences or less are aligned using the tree algorithm, while progressive alignments are performed for larger numbers of entries
<br>

<b id="1D_gap_pen">
    1D gap penalties:
</b>
<p>
    In most cases there is only one set of 1D gap penalties - in these situations the defaults (-450.00 and -50.00) are simply the values for these.
<br>
    In some situations more than one set of 1D gap penalties exist - in these cases the default setting may have different values for different sets of 1D gap penalties. In such cases the displayed values reflect the main set of 1D gap penalties.
<br>    
    If the user changes the 1D gap penalties all sets of 1D gap penalties will acquire this value.
<br>
    Scenarios with multiple sets of 1D gap penalties only arise in alignments that contain multiple alignment steps.
<br><br><i>
    Example: A structure-sequence alignment of multiple structures and sequences includes one multiple structure alignment, one multiple sequence alignment and one structure-sequence alignment.
<br>
    Each of these alignments have a distinct set of 1D gap penalties.
